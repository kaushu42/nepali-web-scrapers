# nepali-web-scrapers

A collection of scripts that I used to scrape data. I used the data to train several machine learning models. Some scripts may need modification to work.

I have not included all the possible categories for each site. You can add new categories which I may have missed in the respective notebooks and scrape them as well.
Feel free to use these notebooks.


**I DO NOT OWN ANY CONTENT IN ANY OF THE WEBSITES.**
